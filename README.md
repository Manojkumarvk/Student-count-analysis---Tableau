📊 Student Count Analysis – SQL + Tableau Dashboard Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing student mental health patterns using a Student Depression dataset.
The complete workflow includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Using SQL queries to transform raw fields into structured analytical attributes

Loading the cleaned dataset into Tableau

Building an interactive dashboard to visualize student behavior, demographics, and depression indicators

The goal of this project is to uncover key insights related to student stress levels, sleep habits, academic performance, lifestyle choices, and mental health trends.

🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

To identify depression level patterns among students

To analyze demographic distributions (age, gender, occupation, city, etc.)

To evaluate academic and lifestyle factors contributing to mental health

To visualize stress, sleep duration, study hours, social support & work-life balance

To build a fully interactive Tableau dashboard with filters and drill-down insights

🛠️ Data Cleaning in SQL Server

All preprocessing and transformation steps were performed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Key SQL tasks performed:

✔ Removing null / inconsistent data
✔ Standardizing categorical fields (e.g., Yes/No, Gender, Age Groups)
✔ Deriving new columns:

Depression_Category

Stress_Level

Sleep_Category

Study_Hours_Classification
✔ Fixing incorrect format issues
✔ Converting text values to numerical scales for analysis
✔ Exporting cleaned dataset for Tableau integration

Using SQL as the main data engine ensures accuracy, optimized performance, and reproducibility.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes attributes such as:

Age, Gender, Occupation

Academic Pressure

Study Hours

Sleep Duration

Social Support

Family History of Depression

Work/Study Stress

Suicidal Thoughts

Financial Stress

Depression Level

City & Institution Type

This combination of demographic + academic + psychological factors allows for deep analysis of student wellbeing.

📊 Tableau Dashboard Features
🔹 1. Depression Level Breakdown

A clear visualization showing the distribution of:

Low depression

Moderate depression

High / severe depression

Helps institutions understand the mental wellness state of their students.

🔹 2. Stress Level vs Sleep Duration

A comparative analysis showing:

How low sleep hours correlate with higher stress

Patterns across different age groups and student types

🔹 3. Study Hours and Academic Pressure

Visualizing:

Students studying 6+ hours vs depression levels

Academic workload as a direct mental health indicator

🔹 4. Demographic Insights

Interactive visuals for:

Gender-based depression rates

Age category breakdown

City-wise student distribution

🔹 5. Lifestyle & Psychological Factors

Charts that explore relationships between:

Social support

Family history

Suicidal thoughts

Financial stress

Overall mental health

🧩 Interactive Filters

The dashboard includes slicers for:

Gender

Age Group

Occupation

Academic Pressure

Sleep Duration

Study Hours

Financial Stress

City

These filters allow deeper, personalized analysis for counselors, researchers, and academic institutions.

📈 Key Insights (Examples)

Students with high academic pressure show significantly higher depression levels.

Short sleep duration (less than 5 hours) strongly correlates with increased stress.

Students lacking social support report more negative psychological indicators.

Financial stress plays a major role in emotional wellbeing.

Certain demographic groups show clear patterns of mental fatigue and depression.
